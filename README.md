Stand-Up Schedule
Below is an example of your stand-ups should look for each two day sprint. Take some time as a group to figure out the best structure for maintaining consistent and open communication. Creating an established stand-up structure at the beginning and sticking to it will be invaluable to your team as you progress through the project. If you are using a project management tool like Waffle, be sure to incorporate that workflow here.
